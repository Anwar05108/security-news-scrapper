Ref: Series 3 episode 5 ‚Äì I turned this on to listen to a podcast about computer security, which interests me.   After the childish comments about a presenter‚Äôs haircut and who is virtually on the left or right, the irrelevant comments about the English language and poetry, the silly noises which would have embarrassed a ten year old and  laughing at your own jokes, I admit the rest might have been interesting but I didn‚Äôt stay to find out.
Either this is a podcast about computer security or it isn‚Äôt.  I‚Äôm not against a bit of fun but the childishness went on far too long at the beginning.
I hear you, and I sympathise a bit‚Ä¶ but I also sympathise with the alternative view of those listeners who say, ‚ÄúI enjoy hearing a bit of fun along with the serious stuff, because I already read the articles to get the specifics. I don‚Äôt listen the same way I read, so I don‚Äôt want to hear exactly the same content again. In fact, I like a few laughs along the way, given that I know there will be plenty of expertise in there, too.‚Äù
As it happens, I‚Äôve been on the Naked Security Podcast for 100s of episodes, back from before it was even called the Naked Security Podcast, and for several years it was edited very precisely (by me, in fact :-) to 20 minutes or less ‚Äì about half its current length. A lot of people liked that ‚Äì we presented with a huge intensity and a very high signal to noise ratio. 
However, many listeners regularly asked us to let the podcast evolve into a longer and more free-flowing form, saying that we should allow a bit more personality and banter into the show. That‚Äôs because they were generally listening under what you might call free-flowing conditions, such as during their commute or during their tea break, which is not the way they consumed our written content. Simply put, they enjoyed hearing us enjoying ourselves while discussing cybersecurity, a topic about which it is surprisingly easy to be boring.
To be fair to us, in this episode we covered the Chrome bug starting at the 2-minute mark, which is pretty early on, and from about the 7-minute mark the majority of the content was about Flash insecurity, malware-as-a-service developments, and image exploits. So although I take your point that we could have edited this episode more ruthlessly, and perhaps shortened some of the side-show material, IMO there was nevertheless a decent proportion of security content in there. 
Perhaps it would help if we put timecodes in the shownotes to denote the exact point at which the pure-play cybersecurity sections start, to make it easy for you to skip over the bits you don‚Äôt need or want? (You can FFWD by just dragging the audio cursor ahead to the desired spot.)
Bet you‚Äôre fun at Parties
I remember a website that require flash player: VMware vCenter, since the older version have only limited functionalities with the HTML5 versions.
Older version (before 6) does not support anything except flash.
And yes I know it‚Äôs a version in EOL but that does not make it disappear from customare enviroments üôÅ
As far as I can see, even the most recent vCenter versions before 6 were last updated more than two years ago‚Ä¶ sounds a bit risky to keep running them even if they did support HTML5.
