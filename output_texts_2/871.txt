Sophos Home protects every Mac and PC in your home 
We’re absolutely delighted – delighted and proud! – to report that we won not one but two awards at last night’s European Cybersecurity Blogger Awards 2020.
The awards usually take place alongside the Infosec show in London, England, but for rather obvious reasons both Infosec and the awards bash were cancelled this year.
So the cocktails were virtual this time, but the prizes weren’t – and we bagged two of them:
Wow!
Thanks to all of you who took the trouble to vote for us – we really appreciate it, because you’re the Naked Security community that makes it all worthwhile.
Indeed, to everyone who reads our articles, watches our videos, listens to our podcasts, comments on Naked Security and joins in with us on social media: we couldn’t do what we do without you.
To earn your votes and come out on top in these awards really means a lot to us!
By the way, while we’re on the subject of “legends of security”, please join me in congratulating our Editor-in-Chief, Anna Brading, who really does make the Naked Security team greater than the sum of its parts.
Many of you will know Anna as the host of our Naked Security podcast, but that’s just one tiny part of what she does.
It’s thanks to Anna’s insightful editorial direction that we’re able to pick the right stories to cover, to maintain a consistent style and quality, and most importantly to ensure that our articles don’t just tell you the news but include “What to do” advice that is technically correct, useful, and – best of all – written in plain English.
Oh, and, if you don’t mind us mentioning it again, it’s thanks to Anna that we keep on winning awards!
Once more, to all of you who voted for us, thanks, and “Woo hoo!”

Congrats! you guys really do deserve it. This is the ONLY blog that i read on a regular basis. keep up the great work!
Thanks!
Gratz on the awards, well deserved! Yours is one of two blogs I try an read every day for security news.
Thanks!
Next year you better organize some free Sophos Home Pemium licences for voters 😛
So happy you won!  Not only is your blog superb, but your products are excellent as well.  Thanks for being here for us.
Thanks – and we’ll pass on your comment to our product teams, too!
Well congrats guys and gals Naked Security!
It is well deserved. Time for a Virtual Pint together.
Thanks, much appreciated.
You guys rock! Thank you for sharing your knowledge with the rest of the world and especially with us that don’t speak “IT” but still want to understand and learn about what’s going on. You’re awesome! 🙂
Thanks. We’re glad you find our content useful.
Congratulations. Always enjoy reading. I’ve been retired from Information Security for 8 years, but you keep me in touch with a subject I love.
Thanks. As I’m sure you will counsel our younger readers, you never truly retire from information security –  even if you get rid of all your own computers, you still have to deal with the vagaries of other people’s computers, whether that’s dealing with the government, your bank, the utility companies, shops, and so on. Glad you’ve kept up the passion for it 8 years on!
Just one example,  but it was so useful to point a family member at your recent article about emails claiming the perpetrators had video of them accessing porn. They found it very reassuring that it wasn’t specifically targeted at them. So thank you for that.
Two so very well-deserved awards. I subscribed to Naked Security in 2011 when I bought my first Mac and hooked up to the internet for the first time. The plain (and so very correct) English is a delight to read and helped me enormously in keeping my computer safe and secure – with the aid of Sophos Home (then Premium) running in the background.  A very big thank you to the whole NS team.
Thanks for your kind words. It’s our pleasure to have helped. In my opinion, we fight back more strongly against the crooks if we *all* raise the bar together by a collective two centimetres than if any one of us raises it by five or ten times that much. (Actually, I think we need both things: ongoing innovation from companies like Sophos, even if the latest and greatest techniques take a while to filter through into wideapread use; plus a general attitude that we’re all in this together and that when we help ourselves become more secure online, we help everyone else as well.)
Congratulations!!! No surprise here. Thanks for your blogs and keeping us up to date.
Thanks, Gerry, glad you find our info useful!
I was reading an article titled, “ Goodbye Naked Security?
by Graham Cluley  and it saddens me to think that perhaps I will be unable to gain valuable info from Naked Security in the near future.😢.  Can you comment on this?
Thanks for your support. Naked Security will continue to be a source of security information, and we expect to publish more articles with a technical and research flavour in the future. HtH.
