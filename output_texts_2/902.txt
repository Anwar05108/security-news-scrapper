Sophos Home protects every Mac and PC in your home 
Windows 10 updates released as part of last week‚Äôs Patch Tuesday appear to be making life hard for some printer users.
Problems after monthly updates are not unusual, but the numbers tend to be limited to subgroups of users.
It‚Äôs hard to tell how many people have encountered the latest glitch but it was enough to register on Microsoft forums as well as multiple threads on that great bell-weather, Reddit. A typical error message ran something like:
Windows cannot print due to a problem with the current printer setup.
Numerous printer makers seemed to be affected. But other problems were reported too, ranging from application crashes and even the blue screen of death (BSOD), which hints at a deeper issue within Windows itself.
After several days of confusion, Microsoft has acknowledged the issue, describing it in the following terms:
After installing this update, certain printers might fail to print. The print spooler might throw an error or close unexpectedly when attempting to print, and no output will come from the affected printer.
It can also affect users printing to file formats such as PDF. No date for a fix has been set but the company said it was ‚Äúworking on a resolution‚Äù and would provide an update as soon as possible.
That‚Äôs not clear but the issue overlaps with an earlier problem already acknowledged to affect users printing through a local USB port. However, the local print spooling issue seems also to affect users printing to network printers.
The updates causing the trouble are KB4560960 for Windows 10 and Server 1903 (build 18362), 1909 (build 18363), and KB4557957 for the 2004 version (build 19041) released on 9 June.
Until Microsoft issues a fix, the only reliable way around the issue is to temporarily uninstall last week‚Äôs updates.
It‚Äôs also been reported that replacing the generic Windows HP PCL5 printer drivers with PCL6 might do the trick (downloaded for each printer manufacturer separately).
The print spooling issue can be bypassed by connecting a powered-on printer to a USB port before starting Windows.
The latest screw-up follows hot on the heels of May‚Äôs printer security vulnerability, PrintDemon.

Printer!?!?
What about audio?
Completely pooched my audio settings so I don‚Äôt know what to do.
Can no longer get Netflix audio on any browser but the bleeping edge they also pushed to me (FF, PaleMoon, Vivaldi).
Windows 10 OS Version 1909 (Build 18363.900)

#BewareMS_Updates
You left out Windows 10 1809 whose end of service date has been extended to Nov 10, 2020. This version KB4561608 also experienced the same problem.  Microsoft has released a fix for this printing issue in KB4567512 (for 1903 and 1909) and KB4567513 (for 1809) and we are actively testing it with no issues to report so far.
I agree we left out Windows 10 1809. I have problem with Virtual Printers. I installed KB4567513  and nothing happen except less space in harddisk.
MS also needs to fix the recent post Windows update problem that killed my Home/Student Office edition.  
Regards,
According to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-information/windows-message-center#437 there is an update to fix this.(See actual page for links)

I tried the version 1909. Doesn‚Äôt work.
Because I‚Äôm so technically challenged-I just bought a new printerüò£
Me too
I wonder if MS is regretting firing most of their QA staff yet? It‚Äôs amazing how many updates MS has screwed up the past couple of years. Before this continuously upgraded and never stable Windows 10 debacle I was getting pretty comfortable installing Windows Updates as soon as they came out. Since Windows 10 I wait at least 2 weeks and usually 3-4. They really have made a mess of things.
Why stop at just problems with printers? How about the time constantly having to be reverted back to the correct time?
Slow internet speeds (no it‚Äôs not the computer or router as my Windows 7 PC under my desk is perfect and runs from the same wifi dongle)
In fact the whole damn OS seems to be useless. Which bright spark thought Windows 10 would be any good? I‚Äôd rather use Vista or WinMe than 10!
KB4567512 resulted in blue screen on Dell XPS 13 9360 (3 years old, quality laptop, completely factory, no mods). This was no fluke, recovered the laptop, was fine up until applying this KB, then it blue screened again when this patch applied. Contacted MS Support who indicated they will pull the release Thursday 6/25.
I thought it was my Brother printer that was going defunct I disconnected it and took it to recycling now I don‚Äôt have a printer at all. Plus I tried to uninstall the update that caused the problem and I can‚Äôt uninstall any updates this is really messed everything up for me.
Yeah I can‚Äôt print to my $400 brother laserjet HL-4040CDN.
Bill Gates ought to take care of business.
For Win 10 Pro 1909: I uninstalled update KB4560960 from Jun 9 2020 and now I can print to my Brother printer again!! You can uninstall by going to Settings > Windows Update > View Update History > then click ‚ÄúUninstall updates‚Äù and select the one I identified above.
Windows wont let me uninstall. All restore points from before update, gone.
I tried this. It won‚Äôt let me uninstall it!
I tell you for a month now I haven‚Äôt been able to print anything despite doing everything MS asks. Every day I have to go to the library to print my work. This is the result of supporting Ms for so man years!!!
I have been surprised that no law firms have put together a class action suit against Windows years ago. Even Windows so-called iron clad user agreements should not be able to stand up against all of these forced product updates leading to product malfunctions. It is an example of gross corporate hubris to allow a company to act this way over and over and over again.
As some readers here have pointed out, removing the ‚Äúforced update‚Äù sorted out the problem. To expect every update to behave perfectly with every printer driver from every vendor‚Ä¶ I think that‚Äôs a bit of a pipedream.
When Microsoft was all laissez faire about updates, they were rountinely criticised for letting people get way out of date.
We have only ourselves to blame. Our demand for variety and choice has forced companies like Microsoft to have no choice but to support hundreds or thousands of devices and system configurations. It‚Äôs just inevitable that there will be problems. Let us get to a point where they only need to support half a dozen printers and we‚Äôd be in a much better place. But no, nobody will allow that. So we just need to suck it up and wait things out.
my work around‚Ä¶ add printer to wireless network, email document to phone, print from phone. F Microsoft.
fix does not work when windows has has pre installed driver/brothers
no printing now for 2 weeks!‚Ä¶.
Hello. Since Windows 10 2004 x64 build 19041.331 may and june updates ‚Äì i.e. KB4557968, KB4560366 and KB4557957 ‚Äì ruined all printing capacity on my Lenovo X280. Could not solve this problem by uninstalling KB4557957 or installing KB4567523 or stopping and restarting spooler or connecting an USB printer and turning it on befor turning on Windows or using Windows troubleshooting utility. I think the problem is not fixed yet.
I have Win 10 2004 x64 build 19041.329 on my MSI Cubi SFF Desktop and my MSI GL73 9SC Gaming Laptop and finally got my Brother MFC-5895CW working again after uninstalling both KB4560960 and KB4557957 from both computers.  I have to keep resetting my ‚ÄúPause Windows Updates‚Äù because the KB457957 keeps trying to reinstall itself!!  So now I‚Äôm getting No updates at all just so I can use my printer.  Guess I need to dust off my MSI Win 7 Laptop until MS gets their S#!t together.
Have not been able to print for a month.  Come on.  Quit using us as your testers.
For the past 2 months I have had to go in and uninstall the updates so that I can use my wireless printer.  I have now turned the updates off for the longest possible time until Microsoft can get their act together.
Hello. Windows 10 2004 x64 build 19041.331 may and june updates ‚Äì i.e. KB4557968, KB4560366 and KB4557957 ‚Äì ruined all printing capacity on my Lenovo X280.

Windows support could not fix it either.
Hi.
i have Network printer error on window 10 after some updates.
now window can‚Äôt send printing command on printer.
Every Time Command also disappear from printer queue.
Kindly give me some hint for solution.
Network printer error!
I think here is some error due to blocking by Window defender.
my cannon pixma 6600d printer stopped working and also blue tooth adptor after the june update now 10 day roll back has run out and cannot uninstall updates. went to try and manually uninstall and it will not let you, what a situation. why they have to put a 10 day limit on the rollback to previous operating system beats me, how many people will just go out and buy a new printer and throwing old ones away just because Microsoft can not stop messing . talk about a un green company
Need class action lawsuit. I have spent hours and probably need to buy a new printer.
My brother printer was not working, but got a Window update last night and now it is working.   Gates should be ashamed.
Did MS publicise this problem?
I‚Äôm 77 in lockdown, important documents to print. I have been tearing out what‚Äôs left of my hair because all of a sudden my printer wouldn‚Äôt function. I found out today by a fluke.
Companies like Microsoft should work to the lowest common denominator i.e. me me and make sure the message gets out through the most basic channels. We see all kinds of useless adverts ‚Äì surely it would have been possible to flash a message on screen or to send a mass email
My deskjet a1 printer stopped since latest update.  About to buy a brand new one about 1200 pounds.
Just hope  I don‚Äôt get the Same problem
I think the User Agreements should become void when their update affects so many people in a negative way. It‚Äôs not just a random person here.and there. This is hours of frustration, and a sizable amount of money to be spent to replace perfectly good printers and unopened ink cartridges at nearly $100 apiece. 
I am 72 years old today and only working part-time. I have two laser printers, each with three unused cartridges. (two different models)
After much frustration, I was able to uninstall, reinstall and update the newer printer, but the ADF tray will not feed now. So, copies one at a time only. My work involves multiple copies at a time. :-/
The older printer will not uninstall or update.
Can anyone tell me if this sort of thing happens offen with a Mac? I am about read to give up on Windows. 
A new printer would be over $300 pulse 4 cartridges would be another $400. My income barely covers my necessities!!! 
Come on, Microsoft. Not everyone is making big dollars in Redmond!
My Epson printer will print pictures but cannot print text in a Word document. If the picture has words in it these print OK but words in a text only document just produces a blank piece of paper !
Grrrr‚Ä¶.  my Kodak printer will not print anything.  What to do?  I have no clue how to ‚Äúfix‚Äù anything on here, I just like everything to work.  I hate the updates and apparently there is never a user choice, my pc just does it.
Has Microsoft produced a sound solution for the printing issues they created with their June 2020 update?
I have windows 10, version 19041.388!  There us no listed update fix for this version, and with the subsequent updates since June, the printing problem has not been resolved!  Any Ideas?
I wish they would stop trying to ‚Äúfix‚Äùmy computer with updates. Super convenient when you have a customer in front of you and what worked yesterday doesn‚Äôt today, while you standing there looking like a Jack hole.
Lawsuit. People have businesses and projects they are unable to pursue because of these glitches. I am tasked with hauling a HP printer back to Staples because of printing errors.
Auto update occurred overnight and killed off large Fuji printer / scanner.
Track down ‚Äòa person‚Äô in help.
Something to do with my location in the world not being American ‚Äì locality settings were wrong. No were not, had checked everything they talked about, and I am not a computer person. .
After many screens of being told to do what had already been done was sent a link to a third party supplier. but cautioned not to buy anything there. Queried why I am dealing with third party when only deal with Microsoft.. Bought product from them, and only deal with them
Answer came back the adviser was probably not best qualified to deal with printer issue.
Another person would contact me back. and would be emailed. Still waiting
Ended up removing the printer and re-installing. Now have printer working but not scanning part..
Absolute disaster, but under American law can sue and limit of responsibility is $125.00  if I win in an American court.!
I have not been able to print from Chrome for a few months.  I can print from Edge.  I feel like Microsoft is forcing me to use Edge.  Frustrating
Problem we are experiencing is  PDF printing too large.  Looks correct on screen and in print preview but expands and cuts off the edges when sent to paper. Various printers, all the same
