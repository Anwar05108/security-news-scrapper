Paul,
re: Power Off / Power On at night‚Ä¶
Using Windows 10 OS Version 2004 (Build 19041.572) it now takes my laptop (Intel i5 ‚Äì 6200, 16 GB RAM) about two full minutes to completely shut down and about five minutes to fully enable me to log in.
At least I can go and get another cup of coffee. Perhaps that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs designed that way üòâ
I have a Linux laptop, similar specification. The distro I use (slackware-current, just say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to systemd :-) is set up to load things only when they‚Äôre needed and boots in 10 to 20 seconds, including putting in both my FDE password and then logging into a shell. If I need Windows I can start up a stripped-down Windows 10 VM in VirtualBox in about two minutes after that‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶so I may be the wrong person to ask for advice, hehehe.
