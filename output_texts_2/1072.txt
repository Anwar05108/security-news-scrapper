Sophos Home protects every Mac and PC in your home 
Apple pushed out an iOS update in something of a hurry to shut down a serious 0-day bug. The GnuPG team scrambled to fix an ironic vulnerability that could be exploited during the very process of checking if the data you just received could be trusted. And Europol reported on a successful takedown operation against the notorious Emotet malware.
With Kimberly Truong, Doug Aamoth and Paul Ducklin.
Intro and outro music by Edith Mudge.
