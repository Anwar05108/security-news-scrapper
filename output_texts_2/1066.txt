With Kimberly Truong, Doug Aamoth and Paul Ducklin.

I think I would rather read your newsletters than listen to your podcasts
Excellent! We always put links to the relevant written articles in our shownotes, so you can still use these articles for navigation without listening to the audio…
Wish there was a transcript of the podcasts so that I could read it instead of listening it and easily cite it in school. Most other podcasts have transcripts.
