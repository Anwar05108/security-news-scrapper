I’m also inspired to be a hacker from that movie as well but crippled as the difficulty of training, passion needed and sacrifice of time is high.
Now, working in a different part of IT sector but still try to keep update the latest IT security info and use free time to train a bit.
Respect to all hackers no matter what is their goal as this world is not Black and White but always Grey.
