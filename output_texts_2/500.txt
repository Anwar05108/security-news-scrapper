Sophos Home protects every Mac and PC in your home 
You’ve got two choices, employee: a) let us slide a syringe between your thumb and index finger so we can inject a rice-sized microchip into your hand that can be used as a swipe card to open doors, clock in, operate printers or buy junk out of the snack machine, or b) find another job.
An improbable scenario? Yes. It doesn’t happen – at least not if employees say no… For now. And the US state of Indiana wants to make sure it stays that way.
Last week, the state House of Representatives unanimously passed legislation – House Bill 1143 – stipulating that employers can’t force their employees to have an ID or tracking chip implanted in their bodies as a condition of employment. The bill passed the House 96-0 and is now heading to the Senate for consideration.
The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Alan Morrison, acknowledged that there aren’t any companies in Indiana – or anywhere, for that matter – currently forcing workers to be chipped if they want to keep their jobs, but there are businesses using the technology on a voluntary basis. As the Indiana Lawyer reports, Morrison said that he wants to be sure employers don’t “overstep their bounds” by imposing mandatory employee microchipping.
Privacy is an important thing. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with us being a little out in front of something.
Sure thing, said State Rep. Karlee Macer, who voted for the bill. On the other hand, we could spend our time legislating about issues that actually exist. NWI quoted her:
Think of the hundreds of bills that are sitting and waiting and never getting a hearing. There are a lot of important things we need to be doing in the state of Indiana.
There are at least two businesses that are using optional microchipping in their employees: Swedish startup hub Epicenter and Wisconsin-based Three Market Square.
At Epicenter, the injections have become so popular, they have parties for employees willing to undergo the procedure, as CNBC reported about three years ago (it’s been going on for years, in other words). It sounds kind of like a bris, except something gets added instead of snipped off.
CNBC quoted Patrick Mesterton, Epicenter’s co-founder and CEO, who said – while unlocking a nearby door by waving his hand at it – that it beats a bunch of pocket-stuffers:
The biggest benefit I think is convenience. It basically replaces a lot of things you have, other communication devices, whether it be credit cards or keys.
Mesterton said that even he had his doubts initially. The technology does raise security and privacy issues: the chips are safe biologically, but they generate data about how often employees come to work or what they buy. While you can stifle company swipe cards or mobile phones, it’s quite another prospect to rip a chip out of your flesh.
And as far as squeamishness goes, Mesterton compared the microchip to all the medical gadgets we’re putting in our bodies these days:
I mean, people have been implanting things into their body, like pacemakers and stuff to control your heart. That’s a way, way more serious thing than having a small chip that can actually communicate with devices.
For what it’s worth, Wisconsin-based Three Market Square also had a chipping party for willing employees back in August 2017. Their feedback: it was “just a little prick.”
According to the Chicago Tribune, officials said that the data in the microchip is encrypted and doesn’t use GPS, so it can’t be used to track employees or obtain their private information.
Hey, we’ve been microchipping our dogs and cats for years. What do you think, readers: ready to hold out your paws?

It’s now business, the next will be governments that all of us cannot avoid (like we need ID card or driver license card).
“I mean, people have been implanting things into their body, like pacemakers and stuff to control your heart. That’s a way, way more serious thing than having a small chip that can actually communicate with devices.” Comparing lifesaving technology to Corporate-Controlled
It’s called the mark of the beast . The Bible warns of this and if you needed a chip you would have been given one by God.
^^ tracking and analytics. Its a Brave New World and not sure I want to be a part of it
I don’t want some little prick making me submit to a little prick.
In the US, grocery stores commonly have brand loyalty cards.  These are required for receive sales promotions and such.  Every chain of stores uses a different card.  Let’s apply this to the RFID chip scenario — will I need one chip for work, another for my car, another for processing my VISA payment “card” transactions, another for MasterCard, etc.  Eventually I’ll have a big bump in my hand where all these chips are, and who can remove the correct ones when I change employers?
No problem!  Some company can provide a service in which they collect, manage and distribute all of the data.  How about, say, Equifax?  What could go wrong?
“officials said that the data in the microchip is encrypted and doesn’t use GPS, so it can’t be used to track employees or obtain their private information”  I always mentally add “at this time” to statements such as that. From my perspective one of the main problems with tracking schemes is that they grow in scope as they age.  
I have no intention of having a chip embedded. Although… I can see a new business opportunity in designing RF blocking gloves.
Actually, rather than an entire glove, you probably just need a small ‘sheath’ that covers the fleshy area between thumb and forefinger.  They could become a new fashion line (along with matching face-mask for facial recognition refusal)!
I wont ever be chipped. End of story, and of discussion.
If my job said that, they wouldn’t get to finish the sentence. I’d already be out the door. I will not be a tagged property.
“Ready to hold out your paws?” Nope. No, Nay, Never! I’d rather have a sharp stick in the eye. In the immortal words of Johnny Paychek “you can take this job and shove it!”.Enough said.
Do you people not understand that this is the mark of the beast?
I agree.

Indiana is a non-right to work state. They’ll just say it’s some other reason.
Except medical implants are planted to save people’s lives. They don’t have a choice. If they don’t get implanted, chances are they would be dead or get worse. I’ve never heard of someone get a pacemaker just for fun or so it would be cool. While this microchip implant qualifies as basically just “for fun”.
I will not stand for this I refuse to let any body put the mark of the beast in me
We can’t trust the makers of medical devices to produce ones that have basic security; can we trust some third party “HR Implant Services very Ltd” to produce implantable chips that have sufficient security?
The temptation for them to do a Lenovo and implant something extra and sell our location data etc to various others (Google, Facebook, etc. etc.)
How long until the NCA, FBI, met GCHQ, demand to be able to read all this data?
Putting your hand in the “chip update” machine would have totally unknown consequences!
Find a copy of the Bible and read the last book (Revelation) chapter 13 and see that this    chip was known 2000 years ago.  Then read the Obama healthcare law online and find the section on implantable devices.  Very clever that doctors might eventually be the ones patients trust to inject the chip…they already are trusted to inject patients with flu shots. As for me, I choose to be sealed by God instead of marked by the devil.  This issue is really about who one’s loyalty will be pledged.  The Bible is Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth…if all else fails, read the instructions!  But do so quickly as time is running very short.  (Matthew 24).
What is sad the ones that gave a thumbs down are in the dark, but will eventually be before the Light.
Amen. No one is putting that mark of the beast into me at all. In Jesus Christ’s Mighty name. Amen
Sorry I didn’t post immediately – This is in the first (and others) episode of Futurama. They go to give Fry his chip and he runs away. Later the Professor takes the chips out of his dead, prior crew to give his new crew job status.
I will not ever take this chip is is the sign of the beast, even if you took it out after you choose to take it your under the devil for eternal, im a God fearing person and believe in the 10 commandments, and when it comes to the time where God takes over , the ones that take the chip will be highly noticeable, as their bodies will have running sores all over their bodies, inflicted with misrable pain, as you went under the evil one instead of God, yes read the book of revalations, witch is the last book in the Bible, which is where we are RIGHT. NOW! people wake up before its too late, remember my words.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I also want to add to this. I pray for every sole that receives this chip for convenience. At the same time you’re going to need a fire suit where you are going😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭.
“I mean, people have been implanting things into their body, like pacemakers and stuff to control your heart. That’s a way, way more serious thing than having a small chip that can actually communicate with devices.”
And staying alive is a way, way more serious reason to do so than punching a clock or buying snacks!
Beginning of The New World Order Control ?
One of the final steps
Another tool for world supremacy, they are withholding all the facts that chip can do
Let us not take the mark of the beast because if we we are going to burn for millions of ions. It is simple he will take control of who ever has taken the mark of the beast yes the anti-christ and he will not spare you nor will God spare you read revelations 13 towards the end….
NO ONE IS PUTTING A CHIP IN ME FOR ANY REASON!! I WORSHIP A GREAT AND ALMIGHTY GOD!
Genuinely the mark of the Beast as described in Revelations.
