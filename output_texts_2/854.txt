Hey guys, what’s happening? I’ve been enjoying the Naked Security podcast very much but suddenly nothing but silence now…..? Hope all is well and to see you back soon. Thanks.
Hi, MarkR.
Series 2 finished at Ep 42, so there won’t be any more podcasts just yet, I’m afraid. If we schedule a Series 3 we’ll let everyone know when it’s starting…
Hello, Naked Security Team:
Same thing here.  I looked so forward to what was your weekly podcasts.  Now my life is just dull having to read versus listen to your podcast.  Please bring them back.  I miss your humor.
so, no more podcast?
I’m afraid S2 ended earlier this year after S2 Ep 42 (the one after this). If we do a Series 3 we’ll announce it here!
