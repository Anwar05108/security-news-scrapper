Great podcast! My worst “REply-All” experience? Finding out the hard way what “threading” means and does with email and that often it’s an email default. I am diligent about not Reply-all unless I intend to use it. Enter email threading. Threading in my google email reached out to everyone I communicated with in that thread, even if if they were not in the original “conversation” aka, I forwarded an email to some folks to review and did not include the original sender. Later, EVERYONE was copied!!!  It nearly caused me a legal problem.
