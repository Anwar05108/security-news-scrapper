I like the hosts, the topics and the format. The sound is problematic. Each inhalation by the guests is quite pronounced and is distracting. The effect is that I’m learning about security while having the sensation that someone is trying to suck my brain out via my ears in a most inefficient matter. Resolve this and I’m yours.
