Sophos Home protects every Mac and PC in your home 
This home delivery scam arrives in an SMS that lures you to a website, but then instead of stealing your data directly via the phoney website, it sweet-talks you into installing an app… 
…and the app steals your data later on:

Watch directly on YouTube if the video won’t play here.Click the on-screen Settings cog to speed up playback or show subtitles.
Don’t forget that these talks are streamed weekly on our Facebook page, where you can catch us live every Friday. 
We’re normally on air some time between 18:00 and 19:00 in the UK (late morning/early afternoon in North America). 
Just keep an eye on the @NakedSecurity Twitter feed or check our Facebook page on Fridays to find out the time we’ll be live.

So in other words, just as you should not click on a link in a text message, you should not click on a download/install button in a text message?
Actually, the text message still has a link (you can’t have an app install button directly in the SMS itself on Android) but the link leads to a web page that has a download button rather than a “regular” phishing page. Instead of SMS link -> web page -> fake password form, you get SMS link -> web page -> app download. HtH. 
Don’t click the link, but if you do *definitely* don’t click the download button…
I still wish that you would make transcriptions of your podcasts available on the Sophos website.  I remember data best by reading.
In the YouTube versions of these videos, which usually appear on YT the day after they have gone live, you can watch with subtitles. HtH.
Are we switching away from the email to video?  I like to read it, get bored watching videos.  Guess it’s past my time… 🙁
We usually (read: almost always) do the weekly video about topics we’ve already written about. So, no, not moving away from written form to video form – this one was more of an exception than the rule.
FWIW, you should be able to turn on subtitles and set the speed to 2x if you prefer reading over listening. It’s slower than regular reading but faster than regular viewing…
