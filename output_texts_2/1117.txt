Sophos Home protects every Mac and PC in your home 
How a social engineer ripped off a victim lured in by one of those “small outstanding fee to pay” home delivery scams. The ransomware crooks targeting networks that still haven’t done their Hafnium patches. And the Linux kernel security holes that lay there undiscovered for 15 years.
With Kimberly Truong, Doug Aamoth and Paul Ducklin.
Intro and outro music by Edith Mudge.
