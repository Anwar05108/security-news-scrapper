Apple’s brand new AirTag product got hacked already. Things you can learn from Colonial Pipeline’s ransomware misfortune. Why Dell patched a bunch of driver bugs going back more than a decade. And the “Is it you in the video?” scam just keeps on coming back.
With Kimberly Truong, Doug Aamoth and Paul Ducklin.
Intro and outro music by Edith Mudge.
