Sophos Home protects every Mac and PC in your home 
If you follow @NakedSecurity on Twitter, you’ll have noticed that we warned last week about an old WhatsApp hoax that suddenly reappeared.
The bogus news is generally known as the “Martinelli hoax”, because it starts like this:
When we last wrote about “Martinelli”, back in 2018, we noted that the hoax was given a breath of believability because the text above was immediately followed by this:
This part of the hoax has a ring of truth to it.
Back in 2016, hoax-checking site Snopes reported that malware dubbing itself WhatsApp Gold, was doing the rounds.
The fake WhatsApp was promoted by bogus messages that claimed, “Hey Finally Secret WhatsApp golden version has been leaked, This version is used only by big celebrities. Now we can use it too.”
So WhatsApp Gold was actual malware, and the advice to avoid it was valid, so the initiator of the Martinelli hoax used it to give an element of legitimacy to their otherwise fake warning about the video.
The latest reincarnation of the hoax has kept the text of the original precisely, including the five-fold exclamation points and the weird extra spaces before punctuation marks.
The new hoax even claims that the video first mentioned several years ago still “comes out tomorrow.”
But there’s a new twist this time, with yet another hoax tacked on the end referring to yet another video “that formats your mobile.”
This time, the video is called Dance of the Pope:

Ironically, Snopes suggests that this piece of the hoax – which is basically the same as the Martinelli hoax but with a different video name – is even older than the Martinelli part, dating back to 2015.
Quite why the hoax has reappeared now is not clear, though it may have been triggered by March 2020 news headlines about wunderkind Brazilian footballer Martinelli.
Martinelli currently plays for Arsenal in England, but has been tipped to appear in the Brazilian national squad at just 18 years of age; he’s also been the subject of media speculation that he might get poached from Arsenal by Spanish heavyweights Real Madrid.
In theory, playing a deliberately booby-trapped video file on your mobile phone could end up in a malware infection, if your phone has an unpatched bug in its media player software that a crook could exploit.
In practice, however, that sort of bug is very rare these days – and typically gets patched very rapidly and reported very widely.
In other words, if the creator of this warning knew enough about the “bug” to predict that it could infect any mobile phone, and could warn you about this “attack” in a video that isn’t even out yet, it’s highly unlikely that you wouldn’t have heard about the actual bug itself either from the vendor of your phone or from the world’s cybersecurity news media.
Additionally, even if there were a dangerous bug of this sort on your phone and your phone were at risk, it’s unlikely that “nothing would fix it”.
As for the imminent and unconquerable danger of an alleged double-whammy video attack of “threats” that first surfaced in 2015 and 2016…
…well, if the videos were supposed to “come out tomorrow” more than four years ago, we think you can ignore them today.

Ah, throwback Tuesday, the good old days when every other day you got a warning about another fake virus.
I wish the current virus was fake, I’m tired of staying home and not being to go shopping for food.
Is the best thing to do is delete it or block the contact

Not-so-completely unrelated–inspired by Duck’s story:
I recently learned the Swype app I’ve loved for years is no longer available.
Try Microsoft ‘s ill -conceived replacement : SwiftKey .  It ‘s good at wreaking daily havoc on Bryan ‘s new phone .
( inspired by Duck ‘s story , this is really difficult to type) .
Hahaha 😂 poor people why so vulnerable which I was once admittedly 😎
I don’t understand what the people who start these hoaxes gain from doing it?
In the early days of such hoaxes, the “send to everyone you know” would swamp mail servers and bring things to a grinding halt where important messages don’t get through. It’s like getting physical and virtual junk mail that makes it difficult for mailmen (no male women 😉 ) to deliver services because of all the junk they have to deal with. It is still a risk, but probably less so because of systems in place to detect these “denial of service” attacks.
I don’t know – but I suspect that in at least some cases these things don’t start as outright hoaxes – someone genuinely believes it, tells some buddies, it circulates (perhaps for months or even years) at low volume in forums and community boards, morphing slightly along the way so there are many versions with additions and glosses added by well-meaning but ill-informed people along the way…
…and then one of the variants just takes off and from then on it’s copy-and-paste-and-forward mayhem. At that point, I guess the most widely-dispersed version gets locked in as a canonical form that becomes “Famous As Internet Liturgy” (or FAIL for short).
last thing we need is another effing virus…………………………………..
Dance of the pope…why do people even watch stupid things like that?
Hmmm, they don’t, BECAUSE IF THEY DO THEIR PHONE WILL IMPLODE OR SOMETHING :-)
Its back again, exactly 1 year on!
