Sophos Home protects every Mac and PC in your home 
A lot of technical articles, especially in the fields of computer science and information security, put you on the horns of a dilemma.
To become an expert, you first need to read the article; yet to understand the article, you first need to be an expert.
Well, here on Naked Security, we go out of our way to avoid this sort of ‚Äúcybersecurity Catch-22‚Äù by publishing readable articles that explain important issues in plain English.
So, we‚Äôve picked five of our favourite ‚ÄúSerious Security‚Äù topics from the past few years‚Ä¶
‚Ä¶for some gentle but informative reading to get you back into the cybersecurity groove for 2021!
By the way, if there are any Serious Security subjects you‚Äôd like us to cover in the New Year, please let us know in the comments below, or by emailing us: tips@sophos.com.

I think an article covering why every small business should run a firewall (opportunity for Sophos plug) and the basics of Access Control. Prime example; Credit card machine/cash register should be isolated from users vlan/network and have rules that it can only communicate with the processing site and its update source. Physical security, why the network closet should be locked lol
Happy New Year. Thanks for all the great stories and advice articles.
