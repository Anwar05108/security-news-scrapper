Here’s the latest episode of our weekly Naked Security Live video series.
By the way, if you want to ask questions in real time while we’re online, we’d love you to join in live – just keep an eye on the @NakedSecurity Twitter feed or check our Facebook page on Fridays to find out the time we’ll be on air. (Note that you don’t need a Facebook account to watch our live streams, but you will need to login if you want to ask questions or post comments.)
It’s usually somewhere between 18:00 and 19:00 UK time, which is early afternoon/late morning on the East/West coast of North America. 
For those of you who [a] don’t use Facebook, [b] had buffering problems while we were live, [c] would like see subtitles or use the option to speed up playback, or [d] simply want to catch up later, we also upload the finished videos to our YouTube channel.
Here’s the latest video, where we advise you about the Windows bug CVE-2020-16898, informally and more catchily known as a Ping of Death. 
 
(Watch directly on YouTube if the video won’t play here.)
Thanks for watching… hope to see you online later this week!
