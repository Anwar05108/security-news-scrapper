A lot of technical articles, especially in the fields of computer science and information security, put you on the horns of a dilemma.
To become an expert, you first need to read the article; yet to understand the article, you first need to be an expert.
Well, here on Naked Security, we go out of our way to avoid this sort of “cybersecurity Catch-22” by publishing readable articles that explain important issues in plain English.

…for some gentle but informative reading to get you back into the cybersecurity groove for 2021!
