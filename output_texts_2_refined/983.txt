We do a show on Facebook every week in our Naked Security Live video series, where we discuss one of the big security concerns of the week.

It’s usually about 18:00 UK time, which is early afternoon/late morning on the East/West coast of North America. 
Note that you don’t need a Facebook account to watch our live streams, although you will need to login if you want to ask questions or post comments.
