Weâ€™re back! Series 3 of the Naked Security Podcast will be out this week.
Tune in on Thursday 8 October 2020 (thatâ€™s this Thursday) for Episode 1.
Iâ€™m back on the show, joined for Series 3 by my colleagues Kimberly Truong and Doug Aamoth.
As usual, we wonâ€™t just be reporting the latest cybersecurity incidents, weâ€™ll take an expert look at how they happened, and why.
And, as always, weâ€™ll tell you what to do in order to avoid having bad things happen to you!
