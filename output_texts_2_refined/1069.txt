Here’s our latest Naked Security Live talk, where we answer the thorny question, “What if my password manager gets hacked?”
We often recommend password managers, as we did last week in our article Cybersecurity tips for university students.
We especially recommend password managers for people who would otherwise be inclined to take risky shortcuts, such as using the same password on every site (please don’t do that!)…
…but we also have to admit that a password manager is pretty much like putting all your eggs in one basket: if you drop the basket, you could lose everything in one go.
Watch now to hear our advice on how to deal with this dilemma:
