We do a show on Facebook every week in our Naked Security Live video series, where we discuss one of the big security concerns of the week.
We’d love you to join in if you can – just keep an eye on the @NakedSecurity Twitter feed or check our Facebook page on Fridays to find out the time. (Note that you don’t need a Facebook account to watch our live streams, although you will need to login if you want to ask questions or post comments.)
It’s usually somewhere between 18:00 and 19:00 UK time, which is early afternoon/late morning on the East/West coast of North America. 
For those of you who [a] don’t use Facebook, [b] had buffering problems while we were live, [c] would like subtitles, or [d] simply want to catch up later, we also upload the recorded videos to our YouTube channel.
Here’s the latest video – we give you 8 tips for better security on your work-from-home network:

Thanks for watching… hope to see you online later this week!
