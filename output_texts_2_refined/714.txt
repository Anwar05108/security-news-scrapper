Marriott International has today announced that it has suffered a data breach affecting up to 5.2 million people.
The hotel chain says it uses an application to help provide services to its guests. Beginning mid-January this year, the login credentials of two employees at a franchised property were used to access guest information on this app.
When the breach was discovered at the end of February, Marriott International says it disabled those  login credentials and began its investigation.
Marriott says it believes the following information “may have been involved” although the entries  weren’t there for every guest:
Marriott says there is currently no  reason to believe the information accessed included Marriott Bonvoy account passwords or PINs, payment card information, passport information, national IDs, or driver’s license numbers.
Marriott says it informed guests via email, today (31st March), from the address marriott@email-marriott.com. It says it’s giving guests the option of accessing a data monitoring service for a year.
