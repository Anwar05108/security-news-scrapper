Remember how ransomware started?
It was all about volume.
The CryptoLocker gang, for example, raked in millions of dollars, perhaps even hundreds of millions, by scrambling your files and then extorting you for $300 to unscramble them again.
These days, however, the big-money ransomware gangs take a very different approach.
They typically go after companies one by one, so they can rake in similar amounts of money by focusing their attention on one victim at a time, whom they then blackmail for hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars each.
The crooks, sadly, get a threefold benefit out of this approach: they get to play their cards closer to their chests; they get to squeeze their victims for bigger amounts each time; and they can put much more effort into each attack.
Romance scammers, who prey on vulnerable people online and lure them into long-term, long-distance relationships that are really just a pack of lies, take a similar approach.
They play the field, as it were, on dating sites, identifying numerous possible targets at first before targeting those victims whom the crooks can see have fallen for their “charms” the hardest.
Like modern ransomware gangs, romance scammers have sufficient operational patience that they aren’t out to scam hundreds of dollars each out of thousands of victims, but to scam hundreds of victims out of hundreds of thousands of dollars each.
They might not set out to target any particular individual up front, but once they’ve won a victim’s trust and loyalty, they’ll focus on that person for as long as the scam keeps working.
