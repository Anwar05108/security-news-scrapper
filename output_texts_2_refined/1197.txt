[01’32”] We explain how a format string bug could lock your iPhone out of your own network.  [08’53”] We revisit the PrintNightmare saga, which is sort-of fixed but not really.  [12’50”] We look back at the 20-year-old Code Red virus.  [18’30”] We look at what cybercriminals spend money on (hint: more cybercrime).  [29’10”] And in this week’s “Oh! No!”, we learn how farm animals can disrupt your network. (Seriously!)
With Doug Aamoth and Paul Ducklin.
Intro and outro music by Edith Mudge.
