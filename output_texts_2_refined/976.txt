Did you know that we do a show on Facebook every week in our Naked Security Live video series?
We usually discuss one of the big security concerns of the week – from data breaches and corporate hacks to vulnerabilities and scare stories – in a way that not only explains what happened but also offers useful tips about how to stay safe.
We’d love you to join in live if you can – just keep an eye on the @NakedSecurity Twitter feed or check our Facebook page on Fridays to find out the time.
It’s usually about 18:00 UK time, which is early afternoon/late morning on the East/West coast of North America. 
Note that you don’t need a Facebook account to watch our live streams, although you will need to login if you want to ask questions or post comments.
For those of you who [a] don’t use Facebook, [b] had buffering problems while we were live, [c] would like subtitles, or [d] simply want to catch up later, we also upload the recorded videos to our YouTube channel, where you can view them at your leisure. 
Last week’s video topic dug into our popular article Serious Security: Hacking Windows passwords via your wallpaper, and #ICYMI, here it is to watch right now:

Thanks for watching… hope to see you later this week!
