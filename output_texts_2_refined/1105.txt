News outlet Bloomberg has gone public with a dramatic cybersecurity news story about surveillance.
Bloomberg claims that an “international hacker collective” was responsible for breaking into a network of 150,000 surveillance cameras and accessing private footage from live video feeds.
According to Bloomberg, one of the hacking crew, Tillie Kottmann, claimed to have accessed cloud-based camera surveillance company Verkada and found themselves face-to-face with a huge swathe of internal data.
This data apparently included real-time feeds from up to 150,000 surveillance cameras at Verkada customer sites, as well as other real-time information such as access control data from Verkada customers.
Car maker Tesla, internet provider Cloudflare and numerous health and law enforcement organisations are claimed in Bloomberg’s piece as some of those customers.
Kottmann, says Bloomberg, gave a laundry list of libertarian-sounding reasons for the hack, including anti-capitalist sentiment and opposition to the very concept of intellectual property.
However, the list of reasons rather notably starts with “curiosity” and ends with the fact that it was “just too much fun not to do it“.
The concept of hacking-just-for-fun was perhaps most notoriously adopted in the past decade by the cybercrew who called themselves LulzSec, and whose infamous motto was “Laughing at your security since 2011.”
