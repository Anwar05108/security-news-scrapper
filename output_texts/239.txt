Sophos Home protects every Mac and PC in your home 
Phishing scams that try to trick you into putting your real password into a fake site have been around for decades.
As regular Naked Security readers will know, precautions such as using a password manager and turning on two-factor authentication (2FA) can help to protect you against phishing mishaps, because:
Unfortunately, these precautions can’t immunise you completely against phishing attacks, and cybercriminals are getting better and better at tricking innocent users into handing over both their passwords and their 2FA codes at the same time, as part of the same attack…
…at which point the crooks immediately try to use the combination of username + password + one-time code they just got hold of, in the hope of logging in quickly enough to get into your account before you realise there’s anything phishy going on.
Even worse, the crooks will often aim to create what we like to call a “soft dismount”, meaning that they create a believable visual conclusion to their phishing expedition.
This often makes it look as though the activity that you just “approved” by entering your password and 2FA code (such as contesting a complaint or cancelling an order) has completed correctly, and therefore no further action is necessary on your part.
Thus the attackers not only get into your account, but also leave you feeling unsuspicious and unlikely to follow up to see if your account really has been hijacked.
Here’s a Facebook scam we received recently that tries to lead you down exactly that path, with differing levels of believability at each stage.
The scammers:
At this point, you need to provide some proof that you are indeed the owner of the account, so the crooks then tell you to:
As you can see, the likely result for anyone who got sucked into this scam in the first place is that they’ll give the crooks a full five-minute window during which the attackers can try logging into their account and taking it over.
The JavaScript used by the criminals on their booby-trapped site even appears to contain a message that can be triggered if the victim’s password works correctly but the 2FA code they supplied doesn’t: 
The end of the scam is perhaps the least convincing part, but it nevertheless serves to shift you automatically off the scammy site and to land you back somewhere entirely genuine, namely Facebook’s official Help Center:
Even if you aren’t a particularly serious social media user, and even if you operate under a pseudonym that doesn’t obviously and publicly link back to your real-life identity, your online accounts are valuable to cybercriminals for three main reasons:
Simply put, by letting cybercriminals into your social media account, you ultimately put not just yourself but also your friends and family, and even everyone else on the platform, at risk.
Here are three quick-fire tips:
Remember, with Black Friday and Cyber Monday coming up this weekend, you’ll probably be receiving lots of genuine offers, plenty of fraudulent ones, and any number of well-meant warnings about how to improve your cybersecurity specifically for this time of year…
…but please keep in mind that cybersecurity is something to take seriously all year round: start yesterday, do it today, and keep it up tomorrow!

A Facebook scam aimed at Facebook users, hosted on the very Facebook platform they’re frightened into losing access to.
Meta platforms, indeed.
I’m a bit surprised that co-opting the “Meta” logo didn’t trigger a Big Brother Red Flag in the Facebook backend infrastructure.
These days–with all the data collection, facial recognition, and machine learning–it’d not be much of a stretch for that to trigger a manual “hey check this out” prompt to the DRM division, if not an anti-phishing task force.
I wondered that, too. The company’s own logo matched with an account title of “Intellectual Property” would seem to be a self-descriptive indicator of intellectual property misbehaviour for a company that is expected to mediate in intellectual property disputes on its platform.
Sometimes, it’s hard to imagine the phrase “machine learning” without adding in your head the words, “without understanding”, or to hear the words “artificial intelligence” without thinking, “says what it is on the tin”. 
Example: when YouTube shows me an ad that I skip after 5 seconds… then plays the very same ad about two minutes later, and then again, and *again*, and AGAIN, even if I end up putting more and more effort into timing my next “click to skip” to get it closer and closer to the 5-second cutoff every time, as a signal of my obvious disaffection for the product being advertised. (Ironically, the ads that I seem to be bombarded with most aggressively of all are for Gra**arly, which is supposed to help me improve my communications skills.) 
Or when my iPhone sees me type “https COLON SLASH SLASH” immediately followed by “nak”, and not only doesn’t realise I am almost certainly about to enter the domain name that is most obviously intertwined with both my work and personal digital life these days, but also waits until I have typed “nakedsecurity DOT” and corrects my typing by assuming I want to start a brand new sentence with “Naked Security”, casually finishing the previous sentence with https://, which isn’t even a word. That’s not machine stupidity, it’s machine vexatiousness! (Though perhaps true machine vexatiousness would be a sign of both learning and intelligence, albeit a disquieting one.)
Perhaps I’m just holding it wrong?
The Grammarly ads are indeed rather persistent.  And yes, I also find it ironic. Even though I can no longer name the difference between present perfect, past subjunctive, and future confusing–I still tend to use the structures correctly.
Now, if there was a product called Brevitee, capable of consolidating my twenty-seven sentences into a more-concise-yet-no-less-coherent-six… that’s a product which could help me.
Thanks for the chuckle.  Evidently I’m usually holding my keyboard wrong as well.
Tip 1 sounds fine, but Facebook keep changing things so it might not look like that the next time you need to use it 🙁
As long as you remember roughly how you found out where to go last time, you will at least know that the information can be found by searching by yourself…
…rather than relying on contact data in a message or via a link you aren’t sure of!
(My experience has been that the when FB changes links and processes of this sort, there’s often an overlap period when the old page or menu option tells you about the new one. And if the old one stops working it’s usually obvious that’s because something has changed rather than that something is temporarily broken.)
I am continually amazed when scammers use obviously phony email addresses; like a major business will use generic outlook, hotmail, gmail, etc accounts.  In this case they used [Meta for Business no-replymeta@outlook.com].  Really?  Facebook/Meta would use generic email instead of their own branding?  I have received scam emails purporting to be from major banks using Gmail addresses.  Domains (the whole thing, not the truncated version) are one of the first things I look at with messages like this.
Scam emails are easy to catch out. As long as you pay attention to the email address of the sender.
Alot of them are just generic free 2 use email accounts.
That’s true, as long as you replaced your opening sentence with “Scam emails are often easy to catch out.”
The problem comes when people get so used to relying on spotting “obvious” errors, given that so many crooks make them, that they accept emails that don’t make any “obvious” mistakes as genuine, because “obvs.” the criminals wouldn’t take that much care.
(Some do. So make them pay if they *do* make an obvious mistake, but don’t let them trick you just because they *don’t*!)
I think I somehow sell victim to this. I’m locked out of my account and it looks like my mobile number was removed from the account in general I actually got an email about it but I didn’t remove it but when it was removed it also removed it under the two-way authenticator because when it says to resend a code it pulls up a box which should confirm the mobile number and then it allows you to click okay assuming it’s resending the code but the box that should contain the mobile number is empty. This is a disaster and there’s no fix for it. I’ve done the whole send in your ID tell us who you are thing and they’ve approved it but that just logs me in which I can do because I know my password it’s a two way authentication and it’s got me tripped up every single time. And there’s no way to get hold of any human being to let them know what’s happening. I even went as far as to hand write a letter to the PO box that pops up when you click contact us via meta. I’m not expecting a response from snail mail but I’m desperate! Does anyone know how to fix this or reach somebody I can provide screenshots to show you this is legit happening and there’s no way to let Facebook know about it. At this point I’m just sitting here hoping though do away with the SMS to authenticator technology and I figured that if it doesn’t exist I can’t be locked out anymore maybe? Any help or knowledge on this would be so so appreciated!
If you can still log in to your account, without even needing a 2FA code, then it sounds as though the problem is that 2FA is turned off on the account… if 2FA were turned on but not connected to your phone number, surely you wouldn’t be able to login at all?
