Sophos Home protects every Mac and PC in your home 
The once-every-four-weeks security update to Mozilla’s Firefox browser officially arrived today.
The regular version of Firefox is now 99.0, while the Extended Support Release, which gets security fixes without any feature updates, is now 91.8.0 ESR.
Add together the first two numbers in the ESR release triplet and you should get the same value as the first number in the regular release.
(Thus, 91.8 ESR has the feature set of Firefox 91.0, plus the same 8 sets of four-weekly security patches that came out in the intervening full releases, thus aligning it security-wise with version (91+8).0, i.e. 99.0.)
Fortunately, as in the April 2022 Google Android update we just wrote about that happened to arrive on the same day, there were no critical security fixes and no zero-day holes patched.
In particular, although Mozilla admits that some of the memory management bugs that were fixed in Firefox 99.0 might be exploitable “with enough effort”, no working exploits are yet known.
And with no known exploits at all, clearly there are no known exploits that were already being used the Bad Guys, or zero-days as they’re called in the jargon.
Despite the apparently low risk this month, all security holes bring with them some danger, or they wouldn’t be given CVE bug numbers and listed in security advisories, so we recommend updating as soon as you can.
Click the Menu button (three lines) at the top right of your Firefox window, then click Help, and select About Firefox.
If you’re already up-to-date then the dialog will tell you, otherwise it will fetch the latest version.
If an update is needed, don’t forget to click [Restart to update Firefox] to activate the new version. (Alternatively, simply quit Firefox and launch the app again.)
The full list of fixes for this release can be found in Mozilla’s Security Advisory 2022-13.
Two of the bugs that we found interesting are:
Note. If you’re running a version of Firefox that is managed and updated as part of your Unix or Linux operating system distro, don’t forget to check with your distro for the latest version, not with Mozilla’s own servers.

“Firefox 99 is out – no major bugs, but update anyway!” ?  So if it had bugs, we should update immediately!
I know that wasn’t what the article meant, but I was amused 🙂
Congrats, 🙂   There should be a button/award for amusing:)
